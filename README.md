## Introduction

Server Administration Menu (SAM) is a powerful Python 2.7 script designed for Counter-Strike: Source server administrators. With a primary focus on streamlining server modding and administration tasks, SAM offers an intuitive in-game menu system and real-time configuration updates, eliminating the need to handle complex configuration files or frequent server restarts.

## Key Features

- **Intuitive In-Game Menu System**: SAM utilizes SourceEngine's popup radio menus to create user-friendly in-game menus, providing an interactive and accessible interface for managing various server systems and functions.

- **Efficient Database System**: The Core Module incorporates a flexible Database System, utilizing JSON files for easy and seamless database creation and management.

- **Chat Filter System**: SAM features a Chat Filter System, acting as chat listeners to process and take action on chat messages. This allows for functions such as blocking, replacing, and executing commands, as well as handling players' text input in-game.

- **Admins System Module**: The built-in Admins System Module empowers administrators to add, remove, and manage admins in real-time. Additionally, administrators can create admin groups, streamlining the process of granting permissions to specific groups of admins.

- **Players Manager Module**: Administrators can effectively interact with players through the Players Manager Module, offering a range of functions, such as kicking, respawning, setting health and cash, enabling noclip mode, and much more.

- **Addons Monitor Module**: Based on SourceMod, SAM includes various small addons with unique functionalities to enhance server customization. The Addons Monitor Module efficiently manages these addons, providing the ability to load, unload, and configure them in real-time.

- **Settings System Module**: Handling all modules and addons settings, the Settings System Module allows administrators to toggle settings in-game using the menus. While some file editing may be required, changes take effect instantly without the need for server restarts.
